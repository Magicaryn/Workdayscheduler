# Workdayscheduler
a scheduling application to help organize your workday

This application allows you to organize and plan out your 9-5 workday by adding things to time blocks to ensure things get done in a timely manner. as the day progresses the colors change on each time block to show whether the block is current time, past time or future time. This application utilizes jquery and dayjs to function, track time, and maintain organization. When you load into the page your planned activities will appear from your local storage allowing for follow up to ensure all tasks were completed before planning your next day out. 

Right when i was getting comfortable with javascript, they tossed jquery at me to confuse me again! I like jquery as it seems to be a condensed form of javascript. I feel like had this been written solely with javascript it would have been far more code in the script file. i do feel like i need some more practice with jquery but im sure that will come with time.
